package de.thb.Flight.Service;

/**
 * Services should define all the CRUD functions of a specific class (objects)
 * - Create
 * - Read
 * - Update
 * - Delete
 *
 * All are done through FlightRepository
 *
 * Idea Sketch:-
 * The Flight DB contains following attributes
 *     private int id;
 *     //flight nummer
 *     private int nummer;
 *     private String abflugsort;
 *     private String zielort;
 *     private Date departureDate; //time and date
 *     private Date arrivalDate;
 *
 * So just orient the CRUD functions to work with these attributes
